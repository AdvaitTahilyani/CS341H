Please provide a summary of the lecture:

**Summary:**

The lecture introduces C, a low-level programming language where the user is responsible for memory management. This includes handling memory allocation (malloc, calloc, free), using pointers, and implementing error handling. 

The lecture emphasizes the advantages of C's granularity and low-level access: 
* Access to basic data structures and string representations.
* Ability to optimize for safety, speed, or other factors.

The lecture also highlights the implementation of memory management in C and the process of writing data to files.

**Key points:**

* C is a low-level language, requiring manual memory management.
* C emphasizes direct control of memory allocation and storage.
* Features include `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` for dynamic memory allocation, and pointers for interacting with memory locations.
* Error handling is the responsibility of the programmer.
* C allows for fine-grained control over memory usage, giving users a powerful low-level approach.


**Overall:** The lecture serves as an introduction to C's core concepts, its strengths and challenges, and its impact on memory management.
