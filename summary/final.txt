This transcript is a very short and nonsensical recording, making it difficult to summarize. 

**Here's why:**

* **No clear topic:** The speaker doesn't introduce a subject, like a lecture on math or physics.
* **Confusing statements:** The phrase "This is a simulated recovery" and the statement "Make sure to mention that. That's it" are nonsensical. 
* **Lack of context:** There's no background information about the speaker, the situation, or the intended audience. 
* **Unclear objective:**  The speaker seems to be testing something ("I hope it works") but doesn't explain what they're trying to achieve.

**To summarize the transcript:**

The provided transcript is essentially a fragmented and nonsensical piece of audio. There's no clear message, topic, or objective.
